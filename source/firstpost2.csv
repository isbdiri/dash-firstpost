attorney general state passing money bill attorney general argument decision speaker whether given bill money bill final protected judicial review fact position held supreme court previous cases making important point concern case reducing rajya sabha namesake feature petitioners case also pointed deeper issue allowing passing act not money bill one protecting judicial review could allow law passed money bill effect first impact democratic federal structure constitution second reduce rajya sabha namesake feature legislative process one looks recommendations made rajya sabha recommendations could well remedied several issues raised petitioners unfortunately legally overlooked since passed money bill included instance recommendation keep voluntary drop controversial section act improper application previous rulings issue examined several times past supreme court decision awaited worth examining issue two key factors first act money bill second passing ordinary bill money bill exempt judicial review multiple issues article previous rulings supreme court providing immunity judicial review looked argued rulings founded improper application proper previous ruling supreme court act money bill deal first issue whether not act money bill article constitution needs looked defines money bill includes seven listed matters imposition tax act sought established preamble describes act passed ensure targeted delivery benefits subsidies services etc expenditure incurred consolidated fund india cfi thus per state prevents leakages subsidies etc thus reducing loss funds cfi thus money bill bare reading act however indicates section provision bares relation money bill cfi fact mentioned thrice whole act preamble section section directs fees revenue collected uidai credited cfi every provision deals establishment nation wide identity system based biometric authentication using centralised database act core purpose create identity mechanism use

independent passing section income tax act amendment pmla rules use arguably passing section independent act could done money bill bench concern section money bill bench hearings expressed concerns money bill particular section observing provision could place money bill expected state argued opposite every provision act entire set system incidental section state argued section mere ancillary provision act bench thus take final decision whether money bill not observations bench however lends hope act may ruled not money bill least section struck supposing court rule pith substance not money bill leads next issue passing money bill immune judicial review article immunity judicial review state argument immune derives articles constitution among others article states decision speaker whether not bill money bill final note specify final courts law nipfp working paper argues not money bill must certified one speaker sent president assent indicating act must received speaker certificate well secondly article prevents court inquiring validity parliamentary proceedings grounds procedural irregularity law judicial review parliamentary proceedings supreme court time developed following law relation issues cases special reference well judgment raja ram pal speaker lok sabha supreme court held court may not review procedural irregularities parliamentary proceedings per article article exempt review grounds thus judicial review possible grounds particular substantive illegality unconstitutionality includes reviewing even decision speaker judicial review passing ordinary bill money bill however applying rule specifically issue passing ordinary bill money bill held issue procedural irregularity not substantive illegality existing law issue thus directly support state argument passing money bill exempt judicial review however closer look evolution law issue indicates issues rulings founded case mangalore ganesh bedi state mysore case allegation act

judicial review per articles observation supreme court followed subsequent rulings case mohd saeed siddiqui state thereafter case yogendra kumar jaiswal state bihar dealing acts alleged ordinary bills passed money bills cases ruling mangalore ganesh bedi case followed held procedural irregularity not substantive illegality particular raja ram pal case special reference discussed held not applicable

case mohd saeed siddiqui yogendra kumar jaiswal cases not taken account court former dealt alleged money bill passed ordinary bill latter cases dealt opposite alleged ordinary bill passed money bill difference particular concern procedure passing bills taken account approval houses parliament absent ordinary bill must approved houses parliament money bill hand needs approved lok sabha rajya sabha may make recommendations non binding approval not required passing bill thus alleged money bill passed ordinary bill approved houses parliament opposed one core requirement approval lok sabha fulfilled thus mere procedural irregularity alleged ordinary bill passed money bill however means approval required rajya sabha not given core requirement houses must approve bill not fulfilled thus procedural irregularity rajya sabha severe criticism move describing undemocratic process adopted deliberately mischievously pass approval must remembered attaching mala fides move far serious consequences mere procedural irregularity would indicating worthy judicial review article constitution not protect lack rajya sabha approval second issue passing alleged money bill ordinary bill money bill must introduced lok sabha recommendation president lack recommendation corrected article constitution article holds missing recommendations sanctions treated procedural irregularity specifically article says missing recommendation sanction act required three specified persons governor president rajpramukh act question assented either specific person president treated procedural irregularity note similar passing money bill ordinary bill core requirement recommendation sanction required person overall given form assent thus case mangalore ganesh bedi recommendation sanction missing factor corrected protected article note however article not similarly exempt lack approval one house parliament lack rajya sabha approval passing ordinary bill money bill therefore not corrected protected article incorrect application mangalore ganesh bedi ruling observed supreme court ruling mangalore ganesh bedi holding passing alleged money bill ordinary bill procedural irregularity correct position however ado ruling hold opposite subsequent rulings passing alleged ordinary bill money bill without taking differences account incorrect subsequent rulings cite three articles articles rule without taking account article not apply instance mohd saeed siddiqui case held article lays requirements recommendation previous sanction regarded matter procedure third criteria protecting passing ordinary bill money bill judicial review clearly take account specific recommendations sanctions referred article bear relation lack approval rajya sabha based argued rulings mohd saeed siddqui yogendra kumar jaiswal incorrect position law examination required based specific facts case missing cases mangalore ganesh bedi ruling observation working paper national institute public finance policy judicial

technology capable misuse real solution lie suitable laws however looking even express surveillance technologies installation subject multiple procedural safeguards privacy violations surveillance never taken lightly law courts surveillance technology effect negates safeguards developed years creates nation wide pre built surveillance system capable privacy violations way beyond boundaries law protect real dangers defined actually not solely purpose law established thus essential supreme court thoroughly evaluates technology behind system indeed fundamentally surveillance technology alleged potential privacy violations much larger psychological impact surveillance consider case jones gps device installed suspect car ruled violation privacy kharak singh state justice subba rao spoke

mandatory use technology conduct surveillance purpose preventing terrorism consider executive order enabling nsa surveillance instance allows means used develop intelligence information similar law could easily permit use pre built surveillance system used expressly surveillance note supreme court yet hear pan case respect whether linkage violates fundamental right privacy circumventing procedural safeguards jones case dealt known surveillance device established expressly purpose surveillance surveillance law fact procedures established place time installation time surveillance conducted not strictly followed major issues despite search warrant pucl case similarly prescribed several procedural safeguards prevent misuse telephone tapping laws important difference cases dealt surveillance technology installed without person knowledge issue impact surveillance general raised jones case left unaddressed issue whether surveillance technology installed person knowledge purpose

transfers scheme hurry seems like last ditch effort ensure rahul gandhi rise prime ministership never mind fiscal consequences indian economy tube long family sitting top truth even though scheme touted fiscally neutral not designed properly tested suck money subsidies currently time gandhi family not face one not really question stated purpose scheme idea make cash transfers directly accounts citizens country instead offering subsidies kind case transfer happen unique card enabled banks accounts hindu reports quoting finance minister chidambaram initially welfare programmes largely related scholarships pensions old disabled operated different ministries transferred enabled bank accounts districts spread states january end next year cover entire country chidambaram added later stage would government consider feasibility cash instead food public distribution system fertilisers since complicated far good question government hurry implement scheme scheme implemented districts january states april start next financial year government hopes implement scheme entire country end early scheme high ambition first needs properly tested fully implemented explained earlier piece website issues government cash transfer programme national rural employment guarantee scheme nregs also issues pilot projects carried cash transfers scheme till one particular case people got subsidy spend greater amount money subsidy received getting bank collecting cash big issue might come opening bank accounts card identify every person uniquely india remains terribly banked country something needs set right short period time direct cash transfers system needs get anywhere big selling point direct cash transfers scheme leakages happen current system subsidies eliminated example currently lot kerosene sold subsidised route not reach end user sold open market also used adulterate petrol diesel among things kerosene also gets smuggled neighbouring countries kerosene not cheap india hence money made buying kerosene cheaply india selling higher price people buy kerosene market price subsidy come directly bank accounts subsidy reach people supposed reach not enrich people run current system sounds good paper reality might turn completely different earlier piece firstpost explains called leakages might continue take place hence important run pilot tests various parts country solicit feedback implement necessary changes gradually full fledged launch scheme gigantic proportions not built overnight government trying brings back question government hurry implement direct cash transfers risk screwing inherently good idea answer probably lies jairam ramesh union rural development minister told hindu congress political party not ngo promised cash transfer benefits subsidies election manifesto great line great political satire yes minister produced bbc goes first rule politics never believe anything officially denied hurry get scheme going nothing congress party getting

arise first point launch cash transfers system give congress politic battling string corru charges something new talk important indira gandhi established winning lok sabha polls garibi hatao slogan important talk right things run elections irrespective whether anything concrete done not days come one cunning political strategist country mrs gandhi every congressman worth salt knows important make right noises come results second point comes government making right noises scheme fiscally neutral means expenditure subsidies not current subsidies offer distributed route something unwilling buy would not surprised right food act set place days come lok sabha elections excuse since direct cash transfer scheme place well placed launch act leakages idea behind subsidies may vote winner government india not position foot mounting bills fiscal deficit year targeted crore percent gross domestic product fiscal deficit difference government earns spends vijay kelkar committee fiscal consolidation recently pointed careful analysis trends current year suggests likely fiscal deficit around percent far higher budget estimate percent gdp immediate mid year corrective actions not taken committee estimated government continued function currently end fiscal deficit crore believe kelkar committee estimates fairly conservative might end even higher fiscal deficit direct cash transfers system used launch subsidy programmes guess would case brings third point india today article points cash transfer subsidies estimated worth crore not easy task procedurally one major obstacles would fact many beneficiaries might not even bank accounts significantly scheme nothing address main problem bring subsidies ease pressure exchequer high subsidies basically imply greater borrowing government turn means lesser amount money available others borrow hence higher interest rates higher subsidy also means money hands indian citizens money chase number goods services hence lead higher inflation also prepared higher food inflation years come higher interest rates mean lower economic growth continue times come despite politic bureaucrats would like believe consumers take lesser debt
