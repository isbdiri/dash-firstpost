private sector players banking ekyc model in pursuance rule prevention money laundering rules mandatory bank account linking rbi mandated ekyc lending support use ekyc the supreme court verdict however struck rule in particular majority verdict held government failed show use imperative officially valid documents passport driving license etc prescribed rbi previously inadequate thus ruling made clear mandatory ekyc unconstitutional the position voluntary use ekyc however not clear reading section majority verdict to understand reading section must looked ekyc mainly result section allowed private contractual use a based authentication the majority verdict recap read section following manner firstly used establishing identity individual purpose provided purpose backed law second contracts permitted section not backed law thus fail first requirement test proportionality unconstitutional so far clear use must backed law mere contract even consent based not suit purpose unless law backing majority verdict private use thus argued holding contractual use unconstitutional indicates supreme court not intend permit voluntary consent based use however question arises whether use permissible backed law opposed contract on majority verdict not taken clear stance for last part reading section needs looked here majority verdict noted section authorises body corporate person avail authentication services basis purported agreement the impact authorisation court held enable commercial exploitation individual biometric demographic information private entities the court goes hold thus part provision enables body corporate individuals also seek authentication basis contract individual body corporate person would impinge upon right privacy individuals this part section thus declared unconstitutional possible interpretations when evaluating whether court prohibited law allowing voluntary use based ekyc important understand court declared private use unconstitutional violation privacy whether declaration respect private use pursuance contract opposed law the first interpretation allow legalising voluntary ekyc second on reading ruling argued phrasing ruling referred private entities availing authentication services basis contract would understood emphasis contract lack law the phrasing availing authentication basis contract indicates court takes issue private use this fundamental issue seconded fact private use founded contract not law further said court concern possible commercial exploitation people biometric demographic information multiple private parties ruled violation privacy the possibility commercial exploitation particular not reduce private use made voluntary consent based thus since private use unconstitutional new law permitting voluntary ekyc private persons also unconstitutional an alternative argument in alternative however may argued finding violation privacy relation private use mandated directed contract opposed law it may argued thus court not rule whether law allows use based authentication specific purpose voluntary basis also fail test constitutionality this argument also find support court statement para stated if person voluntary wants offer card proof identity may not problem indicating court left question voluntary consent based use backed suitable law open consent foundation data protection principles privacy such interpretation particular relief many private players banking ekyc unclear picture majority verdict the ruling majority verdict thus not present clear picture this compared rulings issue verdicts justice chandrachud dissent instance takes clearer stance holding private use overreach purpose enacting law object ensuring targeted delivery social welfare benefits this ruled leaves bare commercial exploitation citizens data even purported exercise contractual clauses result violation privacy profiling citizens the framing makes clear private use form violates privacy justice bhushan verdict similarly held section extent permits use state body corporate person pursuant contract effect unconstitutional void this makes clear struck private use founded contract opposed law not private use general money bill ruling to resolve issue two alternative interpretations one return money bill issue clarity while upholding passing act money bill relation presence section key point contention majority verdict held section simply allows used purposes further without taking away section clear nexus money bill affecting status act money bill an important point held section ruled fail proportionality test private contractual use prohibited the majority verdict due reading not address argument petitioners provision like section permits private use place money bill as result said reference court upholding section part money bill uses a based authentication services state within ambit law not private persons thus key aspect upholding constitutionality act relation passing money bill private use held unconstitutional in case allowing private use new law even voluntary basis reopen question constitutionality passing act money bill private use not permissible the fundamental issue argued petitioners ruled justice chandrachud dissent fundamentally creates identification system opposed system enable targeted delivery benefits this system like ekyc envisaged benefits lower costs efficiency had act passed normal law creating new form identification would subject parliamentary judicial scrutiny different nature possibly different view would taken use ekyc however given mechanism created ruling majority verdict order retain constitutionality private use form not possible the supreme court comment possible voluntary use must also interpreted possibly allow voluntary use a based authentication state backed law not private persons had court gone reasons findings clearer interpretation may possible the majority verdict least

193,21/09/18,maansi verma editor note this part ii two part series loopholes personal data protection bill this two part series attempts bring six major dilemmas requires suggestions resolve dilemmas the first part dealt loopholes pertaining data ownership right information act no means no those exercise kind power emotional financial physical find difficult accept no empowers weaker hence importance consent it heart mutually respecting relationship intimate partners citizens state business consumers and since data become important transactional tool relationships element consent attaches data also but happens laws permit consent bypassed first let remind august supreme court held indians always fundamental right privacy in judgment supreme court also outlined importance private realm aspects individual integral privacy would hollow concept individual could not exercise choice enter realm informational control crucial element realm considered important empower individual use privacy shield retain personal control information pertaining person bottomline we exercise control access data consent gatekeeper the government finally put motion process operationalise control data committee experts formed suggest ways personal data protected submitted report draft personal data protection bill pdp the government opened pdp bill comments citizens large till september but bill replete dilemmas must resolved favour citizens privacy achieved true import in part ii series discuss rest three loopholes empowerment children inadequate protection children the pdp bill identifies child person yet attain age years provides collection processing data parental consent it also casts obligation collecting large volumes personal data children operating commercial websites directed children desist tracking profiling targeting advertising children etc while prescribing much needed higher order responsibilities argued bill misses foundational obligation ensure child informed simple explanatory manner need care handling date concerning this premised reality many children involved online activities involving exchange data without knowledge parents guardians little awareness digital security substituting consent parental consent rare instances parents aware child online activities not ensure adequate protection the bill also creates obligation collecting data put place appropriate mechanisms age verification but absence need educate make children aware relying solely parental consent may one hand provide convenient escape reject notion children also agency fixing age consent respect sharing data years also considered problematic reason much younger children active internet need made aware importance data protection for instance general data protection regulation eu provides consent children years age required process data uk children years age provide consent it also argued children given special protection law must also enjoy similar rights data adults for instance pdp bill explicitly provide adult right opt prevent processing data collected basis consent given behalf parents guardian child this imperative ensure meaningful data protection children consent no consent the pdp bill provides one grounds processing consent consent processing data specified purposes but also provides data processed without consent cases either impossible seek consent consent not appropriate ground some problematic instances discussed non consensual processing of data logic provided in expert committee report for function state authorised law state provides many welfare services citizens citizens position deny choose service provider hence validity consent questionable state performs regulatory functions like giving building permissions if citizen refuses share necessary information permission not given hence consent formality in words looked quid pro quo arrangement citizens provide data state provides services but unlike commercial services state services cases entitlements guaranteed law like ration it argued duty state provide welfare services citizens not forced surrender privacy availing services this logic expert committee faulty also argued based incorrect framing first places state facilitator human progress considers individual fundamental rights bulwark keep state check as per constitution fundamental rights take precedence functions welfare state the report anticipation criticism sweeping permission state process data without consent attempts provide checks it says collection must limited necessary data processing must fair reasonable the implication though consent may not taken obligations continue apply for instance state may provide notice data collected without consent fact matter even not position object agree purpose manner processing stated notice the report also argues function state must necessarily public function the bill however use term instead says function authorised law what implications let look example act provides state insist providing welfare services quid pro quo public function authorised law the act also provides state body corporate person use number establishing identity purpose not necessarily public function authorised law remember forced either link mobile number risk deactivation number it argued quid pro quo approach makes problematic people made either enrol program threat denial services it seriously undermines individual freedom autonomy non consensual processing of data logic provided in expert committee report for purposes related employment recruitment termination providing service benefit verifying attendance this apply seeking consent not appropriate require disproportionate effort employees dependent employer seldom position freely give consent refuse revoke some processing activities may require seeking consent multiple times regular basis will require disproportionate effort employer cause consent fatigue employee the line argument seems employee choice give consent require disproportionate efforts employer it argued employer employee relationship lead cessation fundamental rights employee this provision uses broad brush include employment related activities why recruitment covered function often outsourced stage employer employee relationship even come existence why data employee not collected consent providing benefit performance assessment it must remembered consent requirement corrects imbalance relationship citizen state consumer business employee employer in cases collector processor data powerful position thus consent increases bargaining power individual part data further diluting consent provisions allow reasonable purposes grounds added future permit processing personal even sensitive personal data without taking consent non consensual processing of data logic provided in expert committee report for reasonable purposes like prevention detection unlawful activity whistleblowing merger acquisition credit scoring etc some conditions prescribed proposing purposes first interest person collecting data fourth list effect rights individual residuary ground needed order provide flexibility collecting data it may not possible take consent situations relying consent hinder evolution new technologies relying data analytics there two problems first criteria identify reasonable purposes the illustrative examples range fraud prevention involves societal interests mergers acquisitions commercial activity second power identify reasonable purposes future given regulator established act data protection authority india lay regulations regard it possible envision scenario regulations made law limited consultations negligible parliamentary oversight may grounds purposes actual law the law also dilutes consent permitting collection data sources notified within reasonably practicable time period guideline provided define reasonably practicable reforming surveilling state strengthening surveilling state do also think surveillance alright nothing hide that made believe surveillance carried common good suspicious information acted upon not affect rights but surveillance carried state well private actors become pervasive this made constantly look shoulders alter behaviour may not considered suspicious today like criticising policies government may considered suspicious future and surveillance reform urgently required at outset must noted expert committee report takes note lack effective oversight current practices surveillance interception phone tapping border opaqueness it also acknowledges current systems place inadequate for instance report notes recent rti revealed central government passes orders interception every month every interception request police law enforcement agencies authorised home secretary means average home secretary may need approve deny orders every day if home secretary tons responsibilities would position carefully apply mind request within short period time there review mechanism also review committee headed cabinet secretary meets twice month reviews orders approved the committee report notes review committee unrealistic task reviewing orders every meeting noting shortcomings committee recommends procedural safeguards like judicial approval parliamentary oversight process intelligence gathering surveillance interception if expert committee translated recommendation actual provisions bill argued would death knell mass surveillance program but not instead exempts collection processing data purpose security state rights obligations transparency requirement except fair reasonable processing phrase always open interpretation security safeguards place this exemption available law made future govern functions necessary proportionate it argued opportunity reform surveillance practices lost instead committee chose defer task future law it also argued exceptions specifically designed protect continue strengthening surveillance state and wide exemptions law formulated many crucial obligations not apply for instance obligation limit storage data limited period time means data gathered interception surveillance retained forever breached notification also and checks balances discounted name security state immense possibilities abuse arise for instance consider recent incident arrest activists reported family members forced reveal email social media account passwords without much warrant regard forceful search confiscation material home family member another activist without proper search warrant also argued blatant disregard privacy the government needs suggestions resolve dilemmas please fill questionnaire prepared maadhyam let

improve socio economic indices backward districts india many fall called bimaru states bihar madhya pradesh rajasthan uttar pradesh considered laggards terms growth development earlier backward regions grant fund brgf why regions continuing fail develop how much cultural institutional what solutions one thing india lacks badly strong sense universal minimum standards for instance every school meet minimum standards terms facilities teacher pupil ratio wherever located of course right education act set standards but practice still considered alright schools deprived areas lack basics you go country backward aspirational districts called see you see small town comparing public facilities privileged areas deprived neighbourhoods mention seems district not necessarily best unit think comes spatial disparities in advanced districts backward pockets backward districts prosperous areas this struck visited mewat one poorest areas country time still gurgaon district one country prosperous districts when special grants allocated backward districts risk end little deprived areas districts different approach would ensure minimum standards across country rte norms every school weather approach road every gram panchayat village council electricity every village in approach poorer districts would still get resources since largest shortfalls minimum standards resources would really needed including deprived areas districts all course easier said done but backward regions grant fund not achieve much aspirational districts programme not even seem budget so worth considering alternative approach it close two years since demonetisation has rural economy recovered still battling effects doubt anyone really knows if believe official statistics crisis short lived old trends back these trends bleak far rural economy concerned the growth rate agriculture sluggish certainly compared rest economy real agricultural wages barely rising having said official statistics lost credibility for one thing modi government bit public relations agency hard believe economic statistics not massaged for another little direct evidence informal sector accounts large part rural economy annual economic statistics informal sector largely based economic modelling using formal sector data whatever little information available informal sector periodic surveys this approach may good enough estimating medium term trends not geared measuring short term impact shock like demonetisation it thus quite possible rural economy faring worse rather even worse official statistics suggest but dark as agrarian distress rises government attempting double farmer income could share views universal basic income ubi quasi ubi farmers agriculture labourers advocated arvind subramanian former chief economic adviser government india the promise double farmers incomes meaningless for one thing would require growth rate percent per year real terms four years row that pipedream for another reliable data farmers incomes promise not commit government anything tangible as far income transfer proposals concerned term ubi inappropriate the idea basic income covers basic costs subsistence none current proposals india meet criterion there various proposals quasi universal income top quit sense modest income transfers aimed large majority population not opposed idea quit rural areas modalities pose difficult questions for instance eligible much given different categories eligible households cash kind in rythu bandhu scheme farmer investment support scheme launched government telangana projected arvind subramanian quasi ubi modalities look far ideal only landowners eligible transfers proportional amount land owned that sounds regressive on hand modalities may less regressive rational current structure power fertilizer subsidies indeed subramanian proposal replace latter former but practice not happening rythu bandhu transfers understand supplements not substitutes subsidies so not look like good model my view poorer indian states already quit scheme form pds though kind rather cash unlike rythu bandhu pds progressive not restricted landowners in

notification issued government states since scheme involves expenditure consolidated fund india would fall purview act specifically implies benefit section act mandates recipients subsidies benefits services whose expenditure incurred consolidated fund india notification within section exception sc interim orders this turn means notification comes exception drawn supreme court march extended deadlines government schemes bank account linking etc final disposal case the supreme court however drawn exception section notifications mandating these orders led concerns expressed resultant negative effect constitutional rights poor vulnerable sections society despite appeals however court not extend deadlines section notifications not impose restriction government issuing new section notifications mandating thus court not directly upholding section via interim order not express objection becoming mandatory section benefits even prior final disposal case based exclusion effect poor sections society the effect section notifications mandatory use allowed this turn allows become mandatory majority people consisting mainly poor vulnerable sections society dependent governmental schemes survival these include example mid day meals school children pensions old food subsidies poor stipends teachers scholarships adivasis for sections society biggest issue mandatory a based exclusion denial the petitioners case argued extensively resultant violation right life liberty cases supreme court acknowledged violation right equality further government arguments presence exception handling mechanisms solution pointed force paper actual problems ground ranging lack technical capability unawareness mechanisms even cheating shopkeepers others the inaccuracy biometric authentication failure authentication devices disallowing alternate government issued id used instead also major factors to gain perspective effect exclusion consider ayushman bharat scheme as per tender documents issued scheme targets crore families the actual number people benefit higher even percent exclusion rate however means lakh families could affected during hearings uidai reported

specified beneficiaries without a enrolment slip however allowed receive treatment scheme thereafter next treatment enrolment slip mandatory such beneficiaries fact required sign written declaration effect directed enroll also provided list nearest enrolment centers exception handling mechanisms authentication failures for providing numbers enrolment slips qr codes scanned demographic authentication conducted identification for verification first step fingerprint iris based authentication while documents not specify exception handling mechanisms whose authentication fails newly issued notification fills gap well for persons face authentication done if three fail based otp used if fails well qr code scan used the gap left happens qr code scanning also fails treatment without

marriage certificate however new persons added member beneficiary family least one family members must verified verification must via a seeding lastly per documents scheme issued state id required linked within specified time limit the notification underscores issues allowing section notifications the process outlined thus provide alternatives without given government obligation present provide alternatives while larger number exception handling procedures seen problems ground discussed previously different this latest notification mandating yet crucial welfare scheme thus underscores issues section exception drawn supreme court interim orders though multiple issues persist particular based exclusion nothing prevent government taking step mandate health insurance scheme the several

hearings lack integrity enrolment authentication the arguments began assertion data collection happening absence law personnel not qualified collect handle sensitive data biometric process unreliable fingerprints cloned iris scanners bypassed to add argued firstly collection biometric information violation fundamental right bodily integrity further argued receipt government benefits conditional waiver constitutional rights unconstitutional on day hearings affidavit cybersecurity expert presented stated enrolment centres illegally retaining biometric data fact neither uidai people aware the affidavit also enumerated six ways hacking petitioners also pointed leakage data compromises system on day hearing petitioners made argument people not asked give biometrics criminality proof offence proved further currently assumed biometrics captured properly first time failure authenticate later seen attempt duplicity it also pointed uidai ownership software involved biometric data collection putting system risk the act requires complete ownership on day petitioners argued use uncertain unproven biometric technology violation articles thumbprint iris scan not unique changeable test validity the petitioners argued law data collection prior therefore violated privacy citizens without legal basis they also argued large scale collection storage data not meet test proportionality in words petitioners arguing ends efficient disbursal welfare benefits not justify means breaching right privacy billion plus citizens the petitioners argued potential harm overwhelming standards scrutiny act enabling harm must higher not meet standards retrospective validation while launched given legal basis this argue petitioners significant informed consent not assumed retrospect the fundamental right privacy not violated retrospect india nation governed law argue petitioners not people depriving person life liberty possible authority law to add enforced direct violation several supreme court orders mandating voluntary on day hearing bench agreed stating absence law could supplemented retrospect breach law could not validated retrospect on validity section validating provision section act retrospectively validates acts government prior act passed the bench stated section not grant retrospective validity acts govt deems done passing act the petitioners questioned even possible provision they also argued since section deems act valid opposed act invalid they also argued trying correct absence law absence safeguards retrospect section attempts not legal for example collection data happened without informed consent not retrospectively assumed on act passing money bill petitioners argued section act establishes link money bill not essential act an amendment food securities act would sufficed argued without section not treated money bill would establish new mode identification it argued section gives much power state private entity deny form authentication it also noted section direct violation earlier supreme court order making mandating impermissible executive exercise on day senior counsel arvind datar argued classified money bill would bound statement objects since private parties allowed use per section act bench observed act loses nexus money bill the petitioners pointed rajya sabha recommended deletion section provision opt clause the primary argument passing money bill however bill passed bypasses rajya sabha president this argued requires careful strict interpretation classify given bill money bill surveillance tool the petitioners argued could used surveillance tool secret surveillance ability undermine democracy more importantly need protect future generations surveillance they also argued surveillance private entity like google existed google optional service to add surveillance state cause much greater harm the supreme court countered surveillance arguments observation similar data collection happens person uses iphone atm the bench also asked data collection via different data collection via pan card linked income tax department say the petitioners explained problem centralisation data collection data normally silos one place making much simpler track individual ultimately argued not even data collection architecture enables pervasive surveillance kapil sibal went far call rti tool right information state information citizens the bench pointed act not questioned potential misuse the petitioners countered given amount information taken state surveillance reality on day hearing petitioners brought destruction uk id card database biometric database found intrusive thus unconstitutional the petitioners argued even intrusive also collects metadata not biometrics defined regulation on day petitioners pointed information knowledge information silos amounted nothing they also pointed high valuation whatsapp based entirely potential generate information users

petitioners bringing fact senior world bank official resigned issues data integrity petitioners also pointed savings could also attributed previous schemes they pointed law not violate fundamental right retrospect the petitioners argued goverment assumed identity fraud cause leakages they claimed government used older reports make assessments state would otherwise unable present evidence justify infringement rights result enforcing it also argued scope extend far beyond scope act if crook petitioners argued premised assumption india nation knaves if crook leads breakdown trust nation

not mandate use sole means kyc the rbi fact specifies least six documents valid including passport driving license pan card etc the rbi rules time stood direct violation update prevention money laundering act pmla note the rbi recently passed order stating mandatory link bank accounts this subject supreme court decision however the pmla rule requiring bank account blocked linked draconian argued petitioners adding fact meant voluntary begin means pmla rule unconstitutional on day validity mandatory ekyc issued department telecom dot brought question request extend deadline put they also pointed us social security number ssn system in us senate voted individual would right refuse show ssn federal agency could deny provision benefit reason in case not possible individual survive

kyr used collect link pan card bank account numbers education religion caste details they argued inherently personal nature data means protection must ensured if level protection not ensured state not take data several example state inability protect data cited concluding arguments on day hearings petitioners presented concluding arguments retention metadata enables precise profiling it argued collection metadata violation fundamental rights data could used create precise profiles private lives individuals the menace surveillance surveillance even apprehension strikes freedom communication interference people rights respect private life correspondence protection future generations aggregation data admitted state uidai sufficient indicate religion class social status income education level medical history reproductive preferences individual what protection prevent abuse data collection even necessary permitted issues act the act lacks proportionality purpose limitations scale retention data provisions destruction records not exist neither provision alternative forms identification not least intrusive method authentication even compelling interest identify people accurately least intrusive method must used achieve this not it fact suggested credit card like system used biometrics stored card this could faster accurate secure less intrusive the irrationality project arbitrary violative right equality article it also irrational biometrics inherently unreliable the lack opt facility option given citizens control data child not consent enter contracts violation child rights child not legally permitted give consent children privacy also granted indian constitution child right education also not made subject religious objections beast petitioners cited example christian family objected grounds believed mark number beast exercised authority people forced worship the family believed made mandatory made impossible people continue lives thus violates freedom

long feet wide later state shared details security data centres including presence ray equipment biometric authentication he argued serious effort insulate deserving beneficiaries effects corruption the state argued random baring link person generated they added number could never issued linked citizenship they also pointed data sharing could happen consent the issue foreign companies owning software brought the state claimed software matching biometrics foreign companies companies not access data the response course address possibility data could stolen the state asserted authentication happens silos biometric data never shared neither purpose location transaction data collected no opt mechanism the uidai ceo confirmed would opt mechanism act people option lock biometrics the state also claimed matching biometrics happens basis thus not probabilistic nature however day hearings state argued nothing world deterministic the bench questioned probabilistic system could allowed affect fundamental rights sacrificing privacy benefits the ag argued corruption middlemen diverted rs crore funds meant address he argued alternatives including smart cards considered rejected unsuitable fact designed least possible violation privacy he even argued enrolment voluntary act passed removing question violation privacy ensures right life live dignity argued while ag argued sides fighting protection rights life dignity bench noted ag argument seemed right privacy must give way distributive justice the bench also asserted individual rights not made subordinate distributive justice the ag claimed individuals claimed excluded mainly ngos making claims the bench disagreed in addition state argued poor right live without hunger bench countered poor also right privacy the state claimed enabled right food livelihood pensions another argument state poverty violation human rights the state asked choice right life right privacy the state went argue official identification fundamental human right regarding traceability uidai stated not track ip address gps location record aua code asa code authentication service agency unique device code registered device code used authentication when asked open ended nature definition biometrics state admitted definition could extend blood urine dna samples expansion could subject judicial review the bench countered false the uidai given power decide included parliament disapprove rules this said bench amounted excessive delegation the petitioners argued treating people terrorists to state responded saying airlines screen passengers administrative service measure safeguard public they argued serving similar purpose the bench not convinced argument however the state cited several earlier cases right privacy held subordinate larger public interests another argument presented state need look least intrusive something overwhelmingly public interest bank accounts the state claimed amendment pmla rules mandating linking bank accounts necessary prevent impersonation they also stated rendering unlinked bank accounts non operational not violation right property amounted reasonable restriction right the bench not accept asked pmla rules authorise freezing bank accounts asked whether authorised law when bench questioned state validly opened bank account could frozen pmla state explained done prevent money laundering curb terrorist activity the state argued people strive recognised matter dignity pride the bench countered absence choice identity absence proportionality the state argued privacy small price pay ensuring life it also stated privacy strongest inner sanctum mind shrinks move outside world next state argued public sphere right privacy diluted the entire project argued public sphere the reasonable expectation privacy varies according context misuse harvested data on day hearings state argued enrolment collects minimal data mobile numbers email ids optional the state also argued enrolment agencies subject high quality security standards when asked enrollers deregistered opposed agencies currently operation state responded corruption improper data collection failure meet standards blame the state also asked blacklisted enrollers blacklisted data breaches the state responded statement enrollers lacked qualifications tamper enrolment software private enrolment agencies phased added state regarding data breaches state stated reported data breaches referred compromised data breaches not cidr never breached to bench pointed unless protection forms data breaches remain problem the bench asked authentication user agencies auas whether could record monetise data the state claimed auas prohibited failed address bench concern state control auas ability share data when asked misuse authentication records state said collecting data purpose authentication prohibited however bench later asked authentication logs kept authentication requesting entities state answered affirmative entities regularly audited the state later noted demographic information pan card holders collected since fingerprint data also collected the bench quick point left thumb impression taken people could not sign form there also authentication fingerprinting citizens the ag discussed proportionality respect collection fingerprints he cited several american judgements support arguments fingerprinting minor inconvenience minimally intrusive not carry presumption criminality he also argued violation dignity non existent the state argued possible biometric data could extended dna eventually misused entirely speculative court job speculate dramatic hollywood fantasies the bench countered issue collection biometrics uidai power define biometric information failure meet proportionality requirements the state also pointed case cbi approached bombay high court obtain biometrics uidai investigation the uidai refused without affected individual consent interestingly state argued could already surveil people needed would not necessary the state claimed petitioners using rhetoric rubbish the bench observed technology enabled mass surveillance cited case election tampering via facebook the state countered not algorithms profile users like facebook section act makes acquisition implementation system illegal they also argued authentication metadata reveals little the state also added possibility surveillance via cidr instead cidr completely necessary order avoid fake duplicate entities other arguments state included claims citizens not concerned privacy fingerprints relevant palmistry the bench countered issue storing information centralised database the state claimed since data encrypted secure storing centralised database issue despite provisions data sharing act state argued information shared authentication when bench pointed res requesting entities aware reason authentication could share data state argued data could acquired means the state also argued secure data protection law statement bench disagreed the need unique identity while bench agreed unique id necessary questioned whether less intrusive method could not provided need centralise aggregate data especially considering risks the state argued alternatives unworkable cidr necessary transactions point bench disagreed smart cards said state not ensure uniqueness their argument single person could multiple smart cards different entities biometrics they argued centralised database needed the world bank id report cited support need unique identity crucial role plays access basic welfare services the uidai ceo argued existing ids limitations terms scope geographically he argued easy acquire nationally verifiable digital identity on assumption consent the state argued prior voluntary applied consented default however bench pointed consent acquiring not surrendering data commercialisation the bench also questioned whether informed consent could even assumed while petitioners pointed children not legally give consent anything let alone state claimed legal compliance taken care the state also noted photographs infants collected biometrics would collected age for voluntary bench observed informed consent purpose limitation security essential the state tried argue yet voluntary bench countered time voluntary law hence protection rights the bench also noted initial enrolment forms not contain provisions issue collecting biometrics means informed consent the attorney general argued section merely allows existing infrastructure used purposes long purposes legitimate on scope validity section when defining section bench asked pensions included section specifically deals welfare subsidies pension entitlement right the state argued since pension drawn consolidated fund india cfi included when asked exclusions state claimed act specifies mechanisms people not authenticate the state argued denial based not possible section central state agencies require required provide enrolment services the state also pointed ration card could used avail nfsa national food security act benefits absence the state also noted central govt power replace identification benefit obtained the cost benefit argument the state claimed rs crore invested setting operationalising according various sources returns claimed high percent it must noted economist reetika khera disputed claim stating analysis based unrealistic assumptions outdated data the state argued not casual undertaking unprecedented scope the bench pointed effort answer

283,08/05/18,asheeta regidi editor note this copy published may it republished light supreme court verdict constitutionality likely pronounced tomorrow as hearings reach conclusion key issue raised last week attorney general state passing money bill the attorney general argument decision speaker whether given bill money bill final protected judicial review this fact position held supreme court previous cases making important point concern case reducing rajya sabha namesake feature the petitioners case also pointed deeper issue allowing passing act not money bill one protecting judicial review could allow law passed money bill the effect first impact democratic federal structure constitution second reduce rajya sabha namesake feature legislative process this one looks recommendations made rajya sabha recommendations could well remedied several issues raised petitioners unfortunately legally overlooked since passed money bill these included instance recommendation keep voluntary drop controversial section act improper application previous rulings while issue examined several times past supreme court decision awaited worth examining issue for two key factors first act money bill second passing ordinary bill money bill exempt judicial review while multiple issues article previous rulings supreme court providing immunity judicial review looked here argued rulings founded improper application proper previous ruling supreme court is act money bill to deal first issue whether not act money bill article constitution needs looked defines money bill includes seven listed matters imposition tax for act sought established preamble describes act passed ensure targeted delivery benefits subsidies services etc expenditure incurred consolidated fund india cfi thus per state prevents leakages subsidies etc thus reducing loss funds cfi thus money bill bare reading act however indicates section provision bares relation money bill the cfi fact mentioned thrice whole act preamble section section directs fees revenue collected uidai credited cfi every provision deals establishment nation wide identity system based biometric authentication using centralised database act core purpose create identity mechanism the use section benefits thus incidental main purpose act create new identity mechanism there clearer evidence section act allows anyone even private entities use purpose per state allows made mandatory purpose section argued petitioners way essential act in fact act passed without section independent ordinary bill section could passed independent amendment laws national food security act this similar say independent passing section income tax act amendment pmla rules use arguably passing section independent act could done money bill the bench concern section money bill the bench hearings expressed concerns money bill particular section observing provision could place money bill as expected state argued opposite every provision act entire set system incidental section further state argued section mere ancillary provision act the bench thus take final decision whether money bill not the observations bench however lends hope act may ruled not money bill least section struck supposing court rule pith substance not money bill leads next issue passing money bill immune judicial review article immunity judicial review the state argument immune derives articles constitution among others article states decision speaker whether not bill money bill final note specify final courts law nipfp working paper argues not money bill must certified one speaker sent president assent indicating act must received speaker certificate well secondly article prevents court inquiring validity parliamentary proceedings grounds procedural irregularity law judicial review parliamentary proceedings the supreme court time developed following law relation issues in cases special reference no well judgment raja ram pal speaker lok sabha supreme court held court may not review procedural irregularities parliamentary proceedings per article article exempt review grounds thus judicial review possible grounds particular substantive illegality unconstitutionality this includes reviewing even decision speaker judicial review passing ordinary bill money bill however applying rule specifically issue passing ordinary bill money bill held issue procedural irregularity not substantive illegality the existing law issue thus directly support state argument passing money bill exempt judicial review however closer look evolution law issue indicates issues these rulings founded case mangalore ganesh bedi the state mysore in case allegation act question money bill passed ordinary bill the supreme court found bill question fact ordinary bill went observe even ordinary bill money bill passing ordinary bill would procedural irregularity immune judicial review per articles this observation supreme court followed subsequent rulings case mohd saeed siddiqui state up thereafter case yogendra kumar jaiswal state bihar dealing acts alleged ordinary bills passed money bills in cases ruling mangalore ganesh bedi case followed held procedural irregularity not substantive illegality in particular raja ram pal case special reference discussed held not applicable since factual matrix different cases unlike mangalore ganesh bedi case deals passing money bills specifically the passing money bill ordinary bill vice versa here observed key difference mangalore ganesh bedi case mohd saeed siddiqui yogendra kumar jaiswal cases not taken account court the former dealt alleged money bill passed ordinary bill latter cases dealt opposite alleged ordinary bill passed money bill the difference particular concern procedure passing bills taken account approval houses parliament absent an ordinary bill must approved houses parliament money bill hand needs approved lok sabha while rajya sabha may make recommendations non binding approval not required passing bill thus alleged money bill passed ordinary bill approved houses parliament opposed one the core requirement approval lok sabha fulfilled this thus mere procedural irregularity an alleged ordinary bill passed money bill however means approval required rajya sabha not given core requirement houses must approve bill not fulfilled this thus procedural irregularity the rajya sabha severe criticism move describing undemocratic process adopted deliberately mischievously pass approval must remembered attaching mala fides move far serious consequences mere procedural irregularity would indicating worthy judicial review article constitution not protect lack rajya sabha approval second issue passing alleged money bill ordinary bill money bill must introduced lok sabha recommendation president the lack recommendation corrected article constitution this article holds missing recommendations sanctions treated procedural irregularity specifically article says missing recommendation sanction act required three specified persons governor president rajpramukh act question assented either specific person president treated procedural irregularity note similar passing money bill ordinary bill core requirement recommendation sanction required person overall given form assent thus case mangalore ganesh bedi recommendation sanction missing factor corrected protected article note however article not similarly exempt lack approval one house parliament the lack rajya sabha approval passing ordinary bill money bill therefore not corrected protected article incorrect application mangalore ganesh bedi ruling from observed supreme court ruling mangalore ganesh bedi holding passing alleged money bill ordinary bill procedural irregularity correct position however adoption ruling hold opposite subsequent rulings passing alleged ordinary bill money bill without taking differences account incorrect further subsequent rulings cite three articles articles rule without taking account article not apply for instance mohd saeed siddiqui case held article lays requirements recommendation previous sanction regarded matter procedure third criteria protecting passing ordinary bill money bill judicial review clearly take account specific recommendations sanctions referred article bear relation lack approval rajya sabha based argued rulings mohd saeed siddqui yogendra kumar jaiswal incorrect position law further examination required based specific facts case missing cases mangalore ganesh bedi ruling observation working paper national institute public finance policy judicial review money bills summary comes conclusion different grounds the paper points mangalore ganesh bedi court held act question fact ordinary bill unlike allegations made money bill based argued court additional statement money bill passed ordinary bill issue procedural irregularity immune judicial review obiter observation not ratio binding rule law the adoption statement subsequent judgments without analysis discussion argue thus incorrect this argument nipfp paper fact reminiscent made relation kharak singh mp sharma case relation right privacy judgment argued statements made cases right privacy not fundamental right obiter not ratio as known cases finally overruled right privacy judgment laying incorrect position law the need examination court the issue whether passing ordinary bill money bill exempt judicial review thus needs thoroughly analysed examined supreme court this particularly impact act like taken consideration one affects people fundamental rights including right privacy well right equality large scale exclusion knowing rajya sabha involvement may prevented makes need scrutiny houses much important it hoped supreme

326,05/04/18,asheeta regidi the uidai april published list frequently asked questions national dailies effort address concerns the issue arises statements made faqs not much incorrect present extremely narrow perspective portray intended paper opposed actual situation here statements uidai faqs looked uidai stores minimal data the uidai lists following data collected stored database namely cidr name address gender date birth ten fingerprints two iris scans photographs mobile number mail while list data specified act collected biometric demographic information list excludes metadata collection authorised regulations regulation authentication regulations not profiling tool further state uidai not collect data like bank accounts shares mutual funds financial property details health family records caste religion education etc this not however take account related databases like state resident data hubs srdh said repositories uidai data security researchers reported srdhs provide degree profile individuals including uidai data data like driving license numbers passport numbers updates location based transactions family household information statement not profiling tool needs take account enabled profiling the uidai states section act specifically prohibits uidai controlling collecting keeping maintaining information purpose authentication either entity while section true still not take account entities like srdhs established law data never breached the uidai response question whether data breached standard response database never breached this statement presents extremely narrow perspective security firstly tribune report showed data could withdrawn database this much breach database even large scale one biometrics not affected secondly dangers data not arise breach cidr there multiple sources data data governmental websites private entities collecting data various apps using the uidai fact admitted yesterday hearings auas kuas asas required log data includes numbers authentication information the data levels much risk for instance uidai admitted disclosure data government websites security researchers recently reported flaws ma app risked linked databases user data reports breaches misreporting further uidai dismissed many news stories data breaches misreporting given uidai usually issues statements immediately dismissing media reports unlikely news reports first investigated verified even tribune case uidai first dismissed story misreporting denied breach went file fir reporters name investigating matter moreover researchers reported despite attempts approach uidai authorities inform vulnerability breach action taken till report published media indane leak linking bank accounts enable fraudsters located punished this statement issued uidai advantages linking bank accounts enable fraudsters located punished it unclear exactly possible several bank accounts hacked emptied various means report several based frauds public sector banks upi based scam conducted pretext pan linkage many fraudsters not caught bank accounts secure linking this statement untrue given linking bank accounts provided fraudsters extremely simple method hacking accounts simple method revealed scams reported fraudulently obtaining duplicate sim cards changing registered mobile numbers downloading upi based app simply withdrawing money linked bank accounts no one hack bank accounts number alone this statement true extent hacking system number alone not possible this statement not take account risk number poses combination information easily available obtainable the example given instance clearly indicates number combination data easily used hack accounts moreover data like passwords pins etc easily available cybercriminals data dumps dark web these data dumps also including biometric information given increasing significance no one denied services due on question based exclusion uidai made standard statement quoting rules paper prohibit denial services the problems ground however not assessed looking law there several reports based exclusion starvation deaths due denial rations denial pensions instances the failure pos devices authenticating another major concern the supreme court expressed concerns based exclusion ground even looking law section provides two options get benefits person must either applied it take account persons chosen not acquire right till supreme court passes final verdict for instance hearing one petitioner reported denial admission school son family chose not enroll the enrolment forms cite enrolment voluntary in case alternative arrangements need made people choosing not no one store use biometrics there reports proving statement untrue biometric replay attacks report shopkeepers swindling rations reporting authentication failures people there additionally problem fraudsters using duplicate software skimmers technical methods collect biometric data inspires trust confidence identity document india this another questionable statement uidai goes describe preferred identity document india the true statement probably virtue made mandatory various notifications section section act soon accepted identity document india it pointed several times unlike identity documents passport actual physical verifications take place police visit verify residence however none verifications conducted in fact petitioners tuesday hearing questioned whether verification done verify days residence requirement verify whether person illegal immigrant the uidai response enrolling signed declaration resident this indicates verification done in absence suitable verification coupled issues biometric authentication probabilistic inaccurate matching therefore unlikely trustworthy document uidai claims further also reports fake duplicate cards issued people advised file complaints lastly faqs offer filing complaints higher authorities solution based problems in ongoing hearings uidai cited lack complaints filed factor favour given huge masses people even proper understanding digital world unlikely knowledge means approach authorities complain resolve issues when asked tuesday hearings uidai aware many authentication failures resulted denial services uidai indicated not information instead quoting lack complaints proof lack issues uidai needs actively seek address issues denial services etc to start uidai needs investigate reports issues instead simply denying quoting rules not alleviate concerns such denial issues quoting

already started building profiles residents having state installed surveillance system the impact state surveillance person however not issue case the issue whether identification technology law prohibits using surveillance device limiting impact it comes technology behind extent surveillance capabilities technology going back gps analogy fact psychological impact gps device car not change based whether not device actually used surveillance device if surveillance device presence car fact state installed device fact could collecting data points time chilling effect person freedom this lead people avoiding places would normally freely visit people may even choose opt driving walk instead except system like surveillance system even choice for example petitioners case argue every basic facility like bank accounts ration pension school admissions linked system if number deactivated argue would make access basic facilities impossible thus making living society difficult opting system avoid surveillance would also effect legal limitations not prevent violations even limitations imposed law would not prevent violations could possible system misuse limited surveillance capability like telephone tapping evident pucl case to allow installation nation wide surveillance system would make misuse much easier despite applicable laws consider controversial executive order enables surveillance nsa us requires full consideration given rights us persons based snowden revelations clearly consideration given rights new law easily permit nsa like surveillance moreover fundamentally surveillance technology use would take new law permitting surveillance in pan judgment instance supreme court clarified nothing prevent identification technology used voluntarily purpose receiving subsidies act mandatorily different purpose like preventing black money income tax act it equally possible thus new law allows mandatory use technology conduct surveillance purpose preventing terrorism consider executive order enabling nsa surveillance this instance allows means used develop intelligence information similar law could easily permit use pre built surveillance system used expressly surveillance do note supreme court yet hear pan case respect whether linkage violates fundamental right privacy circumventing procedural safeguards the s jones case dealt known surveillance device established expressly purpose surveillance surveillance law the fact procedures established place time installation time surveillance conducted not strictly followed major issues despite search warrant the pucl case similarly prescribed several procedural safeguards prevent misuse telephone tapping laws an important difference cases dealt surveillance technology installed without person knowledge the issue impact surveillance general raised s jones case left unaddressed the issue whether surveillance technology installed person knowledge purpose surveillance impact privacy also unaddressed nevertheless cautious nature surveillance technologies treated whether laws courts recognition inherently violative nature surveillance technology in places like us australia law punishes installation use surveillance device indicating installation device punishable establishing nation wide surveillance technology pretext authentication technology not change fact inherently violative technology the effect method effectively circumvents every one several safeguards prescribed years installation surveillance technology the least invasive violation privacy whether not surveillance technology major impact assessing extent violates future could violate right privacy it true even fundamental right subject restrictions legally invaded within boundaries law but even case surely least invasive violation must preferred need identification technology not justify set nation wide surveillance system something inherently violative surveillance technology calls

various sectors demonstrate need customised regulation for example telecom sector ensuring adequate encryption security requirements various networks essential make sure snooping people communications for financial sector crucial maintain confidentiality security data possession financial entities this still need disclosed routinely apex financial regulator ensure smooth running industry data medical sector even sensitive still needs shareable relatives health institutes research purposes this data may even need shared without consent save life individual for data social media protecting

several guidelines issued public consultation process much like trai the regulatory approach india these models broadly classified command control approach self regulatory approach regulatory approach the white paper recommends regulatory model india approach previously also recommended justice ap shah committee this combines overarching data protection regulation along sector specific self regulation the benefit approach different industries customise data protection regulations based kind data handle any aspects industries left still protected main regulation inadequate enforcement mechanisms india once regulatory approach decided next consideration enforcing prescribing privacy regulations effective backed adequate enforcement mechanisms this fact one primary drawbacks india current privacy laws the it sensitive persona data information rules instance embody privacy principles consent notice purpose specification use limitation however next enforcement mechanisms the it spdi rules require adequate security practices require regular audit practices require body corporate able demonstrate time adequate security standards this fact similar approach gdpr there however system checks ensure implementation consequence penalty non adoption thus despite rules place lack enforcement makes implementation limited accountability indian laws the consequence follow section

financial loss limit scope section for instance many time effects loss data say hack social media site felt much later this take form another cyber attack say spearphishing mail targeting head

phone used may also transferring data for data breach wallet app held responsible wallet company app developer flaw app os manufacturer contributory vulnerability in case liability apply entities jointly severally another option establish strict liability data controller liable loss data regardless adoption security practices this recommended white paper inherently risky businesses this may considered example central identities data repository cidr stores crucial biometric data yet another option considered common practice contracting establish liability among various parties the rbi instance allows financial entities enter contractual arrangements outsourcing providers fix liability agents financial entity concerned financial entity remain responsible violations determining security standards codes practices the it spdi rules require adoption security practices commensurate nature business data possession an international standard is iso iec recommended this approach advantages effect avoiding one size fits approach industries thus also encouraged self regulate small businesses also way allowed lower standard security sector specific regulations information

breakthrough orchestrated several initiatives anchored digital technology venkatesh hariharan director fintech ispirt explains tech different pieces technology coming together since demonetisation announcement november india seen concerted effort move towards less cash economy lot things put place become reality fruits already witnessing form digital wallets bank bank transactions forward looking policies government national payments council india npci no parallel upi anywhere world when talk debit credit cards pin quote nandan nilekani cards know pin security becomes two factor authentication offline world now online space mobile phones becomes one time password becomes know thereby two factor authentication identify in future need debit credit cards come significantly one main reasons unified payments interface upi there actually parallel upi anywhere else world right this feature bank bank inter operable immediate transactions feature unique upi it also simple way make payments we spoken fintech experts regulators around world say nothing like upi countries part banking conclave arguments hinted pushing forth upi transactions making mainstream yes still challenges ironing but fact still powerful technology getting people formal financial systems if look evolution mobile payment technologies around world initiatives pesa kenya instance realise proprietary technologies closed loop ecosystems even digital wallets inter operability issue on hand cash highly inter operable so ability inter operate important enabled upi the factor large inter operable payments framework like upi start seeing people transaction history eligible offered small ticket loans the concept micro credit heavily offline times live for instance say vegetable vendor outside railway station mumbai evening see person comes small notebook writing numbers these informal money lenders but enable small loans sectors tune rs rs people earlier not credit history start building one they start coming formal banking eco system to back pesa kenya observed percent cases users end taking loan digital wallet provider in india even take conservative estimate say upi reach million people instance of say even percent take small loans add significant methodology going towards less collateralised loan ecosystem the next big growth opportunity financial sector going flow based lending move away collaterallised lending current banking system relies heavily collateralised lending time consuming if look lens local kirana store owner wants loan quickly not luxury waiting process complete small amounts india stack leverages open api standards one things look india stack set open apis multiple layers the overall india stack enable cashless paperless presenceless layer consent layer top one layer layer top ekyc esignature built then cashless layer includes upi payments then digital locker layer stores documents the topmost layer consent network so use case would something like say want small rs loan you issue token give bank gives consent look financial records specific purpose narrow period time the bank look records use algorithms give specific type loan plan suited needs then either accept decline it dynamic pricing model better history repayment get better rate interest if accept offer sign using esignature bank accepts money credited account using upi so end end digital infrastructure cashless presenceless paperless transactions consent layer top again nothing like exists anywhere world so ekyc layer well established reliance used get board close mn users jio services this convenient rough estimates cost paper based kyc involves logistics professional taking details manually verifying documents feeding system roughly works rs per person whereas ekyc service providers low rs per person higher volumes could even rs per person this gives incentives lot players move towards ekyc now think mutual fund operators perspective if going cost rs kyc customer going invest small amount little incentive whereas ekyc brings costs allows people irrespective invested amounts get financially included mainstream banking ecosystem we believe almost individuals immediately brought gambit formal financial system this huge impact financial sector india because far lot impediments paperwork long times loan approvals long transaction times visibility funds utilised once whole bunch systems bharat bill payment system upi goods services tax come play ecosystem provide instantaneous credit transfer money immediately minimal paperwork ability monitor usage funds people upi transactions open api allows pull data multiple sources so instance today use uber ola gps apis pulled real time basis google maps api shows map payments api pulled moment driver ends ride money transferred this clear indicator fact innovation happens access open apis you pull different things combine one place so layers india stack built using open apis so say want implement something like apple pay system business done garage back end india stack the upi player offering value better experience win now upi ecosystem multiple banking players upi apps this get bit overwhelming but whoever provides best app consumer experience win end for instance multiple email clients pick choose one want use based comfort level similarly upi apps choice consumers not one app for banks upi become kind cost centre acquire customers basis start providing micro loans so sense becomes customer acquisition strategy long term therefore banks provide value added services plain upi seeing traction factors security need looked it not security also lot factors dispute resolution insurance transaction so like face problem transacting approach get issue resolved and interim reimburse so mechanisms put place the latest chief ministers committee headed chandrababu naidu working towards the important thing right build trust new type transaction method because people entering digital realm first time not expect immediately start online financial transactions there significant amount trust methods lot people accept start using this significant challenge getting smartphone get internet the jam trinity would not able give exact timeframe cashless transactions get mainstream already started happening locality heard friends bangalore local vendors started accepting bhim payments so start towards cashless transactions begun going back nandan nilekani said know mobile phone internet connectivity mobile number becomes identity then fingerprint pin number becomes second factor authentication also one main reasons debit credit cards not really taken india associated costs merchants along transaction fee cost ownership pos machine operational maintenance costs this could give push mobile based transactions minimal additional costs associated from heard interactions industry indian regulators far ahead curve think really understood power technologies the prime minister tech savvy person add fact many mobile phone users jandhan accounts opened everywhere so basically jam trinity call jandhan mobile lets reach millions users price point never

congress raised murmur rolled violating everything complaining privacy without legal sanction etc the irony opposition came home minister chidambaram course also time presiding editing petitions also sir aware big supporter advocate embedding technology governance always supported creation national id platform upa called but mythologized previous government creators technology super force transform governance miraculous manner it backed pr spin substantive examination even read article recently compared revolution quoted historian will durant congratulate government upa government debate cut hyperbole calm reasoned analysis got thousands crores spent simply biometric database contains three pieces information person name age address along biometrics the country must know upa initiated database ostensibly purpose identification even basic citizenship information let known sir several thousand crores spent compiling database not even identify person citizen this question needs answered upa sanctioned expenditure was contention subsidies identities spent people citizens so discussion testing claims hyperbole overdue also debate ensure not wasted dumped design flaws limitations that debate successfully stymied people long thousands crores taxpayer money spent without challenge debate course tragic post script hope last time kind thing allowed the upa government brought bill parliament crores taxpayer money shovelled project perhaps want debate discussion perhaps chasing numbers show talk rather creating substantive functional platform but sir discussing new bill let say welcome fact bill longer called national identification bill rather limited delivering subsidies this good response fundamental problem government inherited the whole database poorly verified database needs slow steady cleaning the process using small enrolment agencies created countless fake entries database getting enrolment fake name become simple getting fake bpl card attempts make national identification platform would dangerous glad fm budget speech said not used citizenship proof simply failed capture information enrolment sir despite changes bill original upa bill many questions remain would urge government carefully examine points raising why bill allowing subsidies residents is government contention non citizens get taxpayer funded subsidies benefits would like government clarify not intention rather forced due built sir clause suggests government intends allow identify proof sir firmly steadfastly oppose the government must realize dangers using unverified poorly verified database identity proof sir let explain person crosses border say assam takes indian name easily enrols little verification this made easy enrollment process little verification absolutely verification citizenship if used identify proof say passports voter ids tax pan cards create dangerous situation easy identity conversion it trapdoor infiltration formal identity processes like passports voter ids becomes identity laundering platform the way survive sir express prohibition use non subsidy related identify proofs as written government database needs significant audit clean time used anything else aware government responsible messy situation definitely responsible ensure protection improper use the language needs change needs explicit not ambiguous sir apart long delayed scrutiny debate strange thing total lack accountability entity verification data believe bill must cast obligation aspect data integrity verification authority also believe bill currently completely leaves authority without obligations enrolee critical issues data security integrity privacy hence would suggest amending clauses sir government substantively expanded privacy protection information section congratulate government recognizing importance the issue consumer citizen rights something missing upa legislations including national id bill also examples section this good well constructed section puts paid defence put upa architects need privacy rights enrollees there protection section it act good the fm remembers easy people get personal data entities liabilities arising act eg call records telcos but sir adequate given dangers centralized repository the cyber tribunals it act hardly active capacity exist kind disputes believe amending section create express obligations agitated provisions act may considered strengthen privacy rights enrolees sir leave another thought since useless subsidy delivery work databases way government use legislation also bring databases like jdy ambit privacy clause law also possibly bring parliament overarching privacy legislation there changes would suggest bill powers adding additional information database transparently done parliament sanction sir clause deals data interception inspection rights conditions propose clause oversight committee expanded include elements legal oversight propose oversight committee attorney general retired judge clauses ones government may explain why need sanction prosecution authority event complaint breach the principle accountability citizen rights theme played government bills like real estate bill why not and clause seek give powers government supersede authority parliament enacted law giving powers authority sir understand money bill but would request government listen carefully asked improve bill otherwise repeat it act section becomes hastily passed bills create problems solve reaffirm supportive government brave decision go ahead flawed platform inherited but let manner flaws recognized acknowledged use limited cautiously directed areas cause damage in future repaired cleaned integrated work databases like jdy lpg mobile direct public spending

cash transfers scheme hurry it seems like last ditch effort ensure rahul gandhi rise prime ministership never mind fiscal consequences the indian economy tube long family sitting top the truth even though scheme touted fiscally neutral not designed properly tested suck money subsidies currently but time gandhi family not on face one not really question stated purpose scheme the idea make cash transfers directly accounts citizens country instead offering subsidies kind case this transfer happen unique id card enabled banks accounts as the hindu reports quoting finance minister chidambaram initially welfare programmes largely related scholarships pensions old disabled operated different ministries transferred enabled bank accounts districts spread states january end next year cover entire country chidambaram added later stage would government consider feasibility cash instead food public distribution system fertilisers since complicated so far good but question government hurry implement scheme the scheme implemented districts january states april start next financial year the government hopes implement scheme entire country end early scheme high ambition first needs properly tested fully implemented as explained earlier piece website issues government cash transfer programme national rural employment guarantee scheme nregs there also issues pilot projects carried cash transfers scheme till in one particular case people got subsidy spend greater amount money subsidy received getting bank collecting cash the big issue might come opening bank accounts while card identify every person uniquely india remains terribly banked country and something needs set right short period time direct cash transfers system needs get anywhere the big selling point direct cash transfers scheme leakages happen current system subsidies eliminated for example currently lot kerosene sold subsidised route not reach end user sold open market also used adulterate petrol diesel among things some kerosene also gets smuggled neighbouring countries kerosene not cheap india hence money made buying kerosene cheaply india selling higher price now people buy kerosene market price subsidy come directly bank accounts so subsidy reach people supposed reach not enrich people run current system while sounds good paper reality might turn completely different earlier piece firstpost explains called leakages might continue take place hence important run pilot tests various parts country solicit feedback implement necessary changes gradually full fledged launch scheme gigantic proportions not built overnight government trying so brings back question government hurry implement direct cash transfers and risk screwing inherently good idea the answer probably lies jairam ramesh union rural development minister told the hindu the congress political party not ngo we promised cash transfer benefits subsidies election manifesto but great line great political satire yes minister produced bbc goes the first rule politics never believe anything officially denied so hurry get scheme going nothing congress party getting ready lok sabha polls as article india today magazine points the government calculation national rural employment guarantee act farm loan waiver sealed victory lok sabha elections direct cash transfer subsidies would or ramesh put aptly getting poll mode aapka paisa aapka haath and done ensure congress party well next lok sabha elections rahul gandhi becomes prime minister india there several interesting points arise the first point launch cash transfers system give congress politicians battling string corruption charges something new talk and important indira gandhi established winning lok sabha polls garibi hatao slogan it important talk right things run elections irrespective whether anything concrete done not days come there one cunning political strategist country mrs gandhi and every congressman worth salt knows it important make right noises come results the second point comes government making right noises scheme fiscally neutral this means expenditure subsidies not only current subsidies offer distributed route this something unwilling buy would not surprised right food act set place days come lok sabha elections the excuse since direct cash transfer scheme place well placed launch act leakages while idea behind subsidies may vote winner government india not position foot mounting bills the fiscal deficit year targeted rs crore percent gross domestic product fiscal deficit difference government earns spends as vijay kelkar committee fiscal consolidation recently pointed careful analysis trends current year suggests likely fiscal deficit around percent far higher budget estimate percent gdp immediate mid year corrective actions not taken the committee estimated government continued function currently end fiscal deficit rs crore and believe kelkar committee estimates fairly conservative so might end even higher fiscal deficit direct cash transfers system used launch subsidy programmes guess would case and brings third point as india today article points the cash transfer subsidies estimated worth rs crore not easy task procedurally one major obstacles would fact many beneficiaries might not even bank accounts but significantly scheme nothing address main problem bring subsidies ease pressure exchequer high subsidies basically imply greater borrowing government this turn means lesser amount money available others borrow hence higher interest rates higher subsidy also means money hands indian citizens this money chase number goods services hence lead higher inflation also prepared higher food inflation years come higher interest rates mean lower economic growth continue times come despite politicians bureaucrats would like believe consumers take lesser debt buy homes cars consumer goods this bad business turn slow expansion plans thus impact economic growth as ruchir sharma
